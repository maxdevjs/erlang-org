        <p>The scalability of ETS tables of type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ordered_set</code> with the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">write_concurrency</code> option is substantially better in Erlang/OTP 22
than earlier releases. In some extreme cases, you can expect
more than 100 times better throughput in Erlang/OTP 22 compared to
Erlang/OTP 21. The cause of this improvement is a new data structure
called <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpdc.2017.11.007">the contention adapting search tree</a> (CA tree
for short). This blog post will give you insights into how the CA tree
works and show you benchmark results comparing the performance of ETS
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ordered_set</code> tables in OTP 21 and OTP 22.</p>

<p><a href="../code/insert_disjoint_ranges.erl">This escript</a> makes it convenient for you
to try the new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ordered_set</code> implementation on your own machine with
Erlang/OTP 22+ installed.</p>

<p>The escript measures the time it takes for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">P</code> Erlang processes to
insert <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code> integers into an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ordered_set</code> ETS table, where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">P</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code>
are parameters to the escript. The CA tree is only utilized when the
ETS table options <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ordered_set</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{write_concurrency, true}</code> are
active. One can, therefore, easily compare the new data structure’s
performance with the old one (an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree">AVL tree</a> protected by a
single readers-writer lock). The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">write_concurrency</code> option had no
effect on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ordered_set</code> tables before the release of Erlang/OTP 22.</p>

<p>We get the following results when running the escript on a developer laptop with

<p>We see that in this particular benchmark, the CA tree has superior
scalability to the old data structure. The benchmark ran about twice
as fast with the new data structure and four processes as with the old
data structure and one process (the machine only has two
cores). We will look at the performance and scalability of the new CA
tree-based implementation in greater detail later after describing how
the CA tree works.</p>

          The Contention Adapting Search Tree in a Nutshell <a href="#the-contention-adapting-search-tree-in-a-nutshell">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>
    

<p>The key feature that distinguishes the CA tree from other concurrent
data structures is that the CA tree dynamically changes its
synchronization granularity based on how much contention is detected
inside the data structure. This way, the CA tree can avoid the
performance and memory overheads that come from using many unnecessary
locks without sacrificing performance when many operations happen in
parallel. For example, let us imagine a scenario where the CA tree is
initially populated from many threads in parallel, and then it is only
used from a single thread. In this scenario, the CA tree will adapt to
use fine-grained synchronization in the population phase (when
fine-grained synchronization reduces contention). The CA tree will then change
to use coarse-grained synchronization in the single-threaded phase
(when coarse-grained synchronization reduces the locking and memory
overheads).</p>

<p>The structure of a CA tree is illustrated in the following
picture:</p>

<p><img class="img-fluid"src="../images/ca_tree/ca_tree_9.png" alt="alt text" title="Contention Adapting Search Tree Structure" /></p>

<p>The actual items stored in the CA tree are located in
sequential data structures in the bottom layer. These
sequential data structures are protected by the locks in the base
nodes in the middle layer. The base node locks have counters
associated with them. The counter of a base node lock is increased when
contention is detected in the base node lock and decreased when no
such contention is detected. The value of this base node lock counter
decides if a split or a join should happen after an operation has been
performed in a base node. The routing nodes at the top of the picture
above form a binary search tree that directs the search for a
particular item. A routing node also contains a lock and a flag. These
are used when joining base nodes. The details of how splitting and
joining work will not be described in this article, but
the interested reader can find a detailed description in this <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpdc.2017.11.007">CA tree
paper</a> (<a href="http://winsh.me/papers/catree_jpdc_paper.pdf">preprint PDF</a>). We will now
illustrate how the CA tree changes its synchronization granularity by
going through an example:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Initially, a CA tree only consists of a single base node with a
sequential data structure as is depicted in the picture below:</p>

    <p><img class="img-fluid"src="../images/ca_tree/ca_tree_1.png" alt="alt text" title="Initial Contention Adapting Search Tree" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If parallel threads access the CA tree, the value of a base node’s
counter may eventually reach the threshold that indicates that the
base node should be split. A base node split divides the items in a
base node between two new base nodes and replaces the original base
node with a routing node where the two new base nodes are
rooted. The following picture shows the CA tree after the base node
pointed to by the tree’s root has been split:</p>

    <p><img class="img-fluid"src="../images/ca_tree/ca_tree_2.png" alt="alt text" title="First Split Contention Adapting Search Tree" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The process of base node splitting will continue as long as there
is enough contention in base node locks or until the max depth of the
routing layer is reached. The following picture shows how the CA
tree looks like after another split:</p>

    <p><img class="img-fluid"src="../images/ca_tree/ca_tree_3.png" alt="alt text" title="Second Split Contention Adapting Search Tree" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The synchronization granularity may differ in different parts of a
CA tree if, for example, a particular part of a CA tree is accessed
more frequently in parallel than the rest. The following picture
shows the CA tree after yet another split:</p>

    <p><img class="img-fluid"src="../images/ca_tree/ca_tree_4.png" alt="alt text" title="Third Split Contention Adapting Search Tree" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The following picture shows the CA tree after the fourth split:</p>

    <p><img class="img-fluid"src="../images/ca_tree/ca_tree_5.png" alt="alt text" title="Fourth Split Contention Adapting Search Tree" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The following picture shows the CA tree after the fifth split:</p>

    <p><img class="img-fluid"src="../images/ca_tree/ca_tree_6.png" alt="alt text" title="Fifth Split Contention Adapting Search Tree" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two base nodes holding adjacent ranges of items can be joined. Such
a join will be triggered after an operation sees that a base
node counter’s value is below a certain threshold. Remember that a
base node’s counter is decreased if a thread does not experience
contention when acquiring the base node’s lock.
<!--The conters The likelihood that
a join will be triggered in a certain base node gets higher when
the probablity of contention that does not detect contention in the
base node lock is high. The likelihood that two base nodes are
joined is also increased if operations that require both base nodes
happens often enough (to reduce the overhead of acquiring locks).--></p>

    <p><img class="img-fluid"src="../images/ca_tree/ca_tree_7.png" alt="alt text" title="Join of two base nodes in a  Contention Adapting Search Tree" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As you might have noticed from the illustrations above, splitting
and joining results in that old base nodes and
routing nodes gets spliced-out from the tree. The memory that these
nodes occupy needs to be reclaimed, but this can not happen directly
after they have got spliced-out as some threads might still be
reading them. The Erlang run-time system has a mechanism called
<a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/d6285b0a347b9489ce939511ee9a979acd868f71/erts/emulator/internal_doc/ThreadProgress.md">thread progress</a>,
which the ETS CA tree implementation uses to reclaim these nodes
safely.</p>

<p>The performance of the new CA tree-based ETS <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ordered_set</code>
implementation has been evaluated in a benchmark that measures the
throughput (operations per second) in many scenarios. The
benchmark lets a configurable number of Erlang processes perform a
configurable distribution of operations on a single ETS table. The
curious reader can find the source code of the benchmark in the <a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/ba2c374d3d6fcba479bb542eb6ecd5d8216ce84b/lib/stdlib/test/ets_SUITE.erl#L7623">test
suite for
ETS</a>.</p>

<p>The following figures show results from this benchmark on a machine
with two Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2673 v4 @ 2.30GHz (32 cores in total
with hyper-threading). The average set size in all scenarios was
about 500K. More details about the benchmark machine and configuration
can be found on <a href="http://blog.erlang.org/bench/ets_ord_set_21_vs_22/21_vs_22.html">this
page</a>.</p>

<p>We see that the throughput of the CA tree-based <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ordered_set</code> (OTP-22)
improves when we add cores all the way up to 64 cores, while the old
implementation’s (OTP-21) throughput often gets worse when more
processes are added. The old implementation’s write operations are
serialized as the data structure is protected by a single
readers-writer lock. The slowdown of the old version when adding more
cores is mainly caused by increased communication overhead when more
cores try to acquire the same lock and by the fact that the competing
cores frequently invalidate each other’s cache lines.</p>

<p>The graph for the 100% lookups scenario (the last graph in the list of
graphs above) looks a bit strange at first sight. Why does the CA tree
scale so much better than the old implementation in this scenario? The
answer is almost impossible to guess without knowing the
implementation details of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ordered_set</code> table type. First of all,
the CA tree uses the same readers-writer lock implementation
for its base node locks as the old implementation uses to protect the whole
table. The difference is thus not due to any lock differences. The
default <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ordered_set</code> implementation (the one that is active when
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">write_concurrency</code> is off) has an optimization that mainly improves
usage scenarios where a single process iterates over items of the
table, for example, with a sequence of calls to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ets:next/2</code>
function. This optimization keeps a static stack per table. Some
operations use this stack to reduce the number of tree nodes that need
to be traversed. For example, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ets:next/2</code> operation does not need
to recreate the stack, if the top of the stack contains the same key
as the one passed to the operation (see
<a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/master/erts/emulator/beam/erl_db_tree.c#L3084">here</a>). As there is only one static stack per
table and potentially many readers (due to the readers-writer lock),
the static stack has to be reserved by the thread that is currently
using it. Unfortunately, the static stack handling is a scalability
bottleneck in scenarios like the one with 100% lookups above. The CA
tree implementation does not have this type of optimization, so it
does not suffer from this scalability bottleneck. However, this also
means that the old implementation may perform better than the new one
when the table is mainly sequentially accessed. One example of when
the old implementation (that still can be used by setting the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">write_concurrency</code> option to false) performs better is the single
process case of the 10% <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">insert</code>, 10% <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">delete</code>, 40% <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lookup</code> and 40%
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nextseq1000</code> (a sequence of 1000 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ets:next/2</code> calls) scenario (the
second last graph in the list of graphs above).</p>

<p>Therefore, we can conclude that that turning on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">write_concurrency</code>
for an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ordered_set</code> table is probably a good idea if the table is
accessed from multiple processes in parallel. Still, turning off
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">write_concurrency</code> might be better if you mainly access the table
sequentially.</p>

      </h2>
    

<p>The CA tree implementation was not the only optimization introduced in
Erlang/OTP 22, affecting the scalability of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ordered_set</code> with
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">write_concurrency</code>. An optimization that decentralized counters in
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ordered_set</code> tables with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">write_concurrency</code> turned on was also
introduced in Erlang/OTP 22 (see <a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/2190">here</a>).  An
option to enable the same optimization in all table types was
introduced in Erlang/OTP 23 (see <a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/2229">here</a>). You can
find benchmark results comparing the scalability of the tables with
and without decentralized counters <a href="http://winsh.me/ets_catree_benchmark/azure_D64s_decent_ctrs/hash_decentralized_ctrs.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>The Erlang/OTP 22 release introduced a new ETS <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ordered_set</code>
implementation that is active when the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">write_concurrency</code> option is
turned on. This data structure (a contention adapting search tree) has
superior scalability to the old data structure in many different
scenarios and a design that gives it excellent performance in a variety
of scenarios that benefit from different synchronization
granularities.</p>
